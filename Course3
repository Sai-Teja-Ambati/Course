Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Sai Teja Ambati
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is the process of determining the amount of resources, such as time and space, that an algorithm requires.
It helps in understanding the efficiency and scalability of an algorithm.
Key techniques include analyzing the worst-case, average-case, and best-case scenarios.
This allows for the comparison of algorithms to select the most suitable one for a specific task.
